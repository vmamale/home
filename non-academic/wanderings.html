          <p><span style="color: gray;">Jonkershoek Nature Reserve</span>: Be ready to walk/run more than five kilometers, mountain cylcing, hiking, just sightseeing and other activities can be performed here.</p>

          <p><span style="color: gray;">Kruger National Park</span>: Visiting home of animals as visitors is always an mesmerising experience. Here, you can drive your own safari. If you wish to get eaten by a lion, just get out of your car and approach the beast. Other than big five(Lion, Rhino, Leopard, Elephant, Buffalo), Cheetah, Birds are the attractions.</p>

          <p><span style="color: gray;">Shivneri Fort</span>: After reading books on Shivaji Maharaj, visiting this place gives goosebumps.</p>

          <p><span style="color: gray;">Tiruchendur Murugan Temple</span>: Watching sunrise on the east shore, visiting the temple and coming out to hear ocean again is a beautiful experience.</p>

          <p><span style="color: gray;">Brihadeeswara Temple</span>: built in 1010 CE this is one of the UNESCO world heritage sites near Thanjavur. Ganesha idol here, established later by Maratha's(as far as I remember), is really beautiful. Nandi idol is also quite nice. </p>

          <p><span style="color: gray;">Airavateswara Temple</span>: This temple has really nice architecture. This is another UNESCO heritage site. </p>

          <p><span style="color: gray;">Palaruvi Waterfall</span>: Good trip for half a day in forest.</p>

          <p><span style="color: gray;">Shivthar Ghal</span>: surrounded by hills from all sides it's a natural cave with adjacent waterfall. This place was rediscoverd in 1916 after search based on description by Saint Ramdas(1600s). Road trip from Pune via Varandha Ghat road is really good. </p>

	<p><span style="color: gray;">Yercaud</span>: Small hill station with paper and coffee plantations. Liked church on a hill, food and newly built temple with wooden idols, nearby.</p>
